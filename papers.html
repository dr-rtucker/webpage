                                    <p><a href="#" class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</a></p>

                                    <p>Objectives: Some criminologists of place have argued that property owners and place managers
                                        are the key actors exerting guardianship over crime and driving differences in crime across
                                        places, giving rise to the “Neighborhoods Out of Places Explanation” (NOPE) theory of crime.
                                        However, research to date has yet to fully evaluate if crime statistically varies across properties,
                                        their owners, or surrounding geographies.</p>
                                    <p>Methods: Data scraped from Yelp.com is used to identify 1,071 land parcels that had at least one
                                        business receiving reviews from 2014-2020. 911 dispatches for disturbances are linked to parcels
                                        and measured as the rate of events per Yelp reviewer in the average year. Hierarchical linear
                                        modeling-based variance decomposition techniques are used to evaluate how variation in
                                        disturbance rates is distributed across parcels, owners, census blocks, and census tracts. Negative
                                        binomial hierarchical linear models are used to assess the correlates of disturbance rates.
                                        Sensitivity analyses assess the correlates of disturbance rates using a single-level negative
                                        binomial model with bootstrapped standard errors.</p>
                                    <p>Results: Commercial disturbance rates vary across parcels, parcel owners, and blocks. At the
                                        parcel-level, higher Yelp ratings are associated with lower disturbance rates while parcel square
                                        footage is associated with increased disturbance rates. Additionally, parcel-level crime
                                        disturbance rates are explained by block features such as poverty and violent crime</p>
                                    <p>Conclusions: Parcel, owner, and block features can all help explain why some restaurants have
                                        more crime than others. Future research should build on the place management perspective by
                                        investigating the wider breadth of potential actors who may exert guardianship over properties
                                        while acknowledging that offenders and targets systematically vary across geographies, making
                                        effective guardianship more difficult for some guardians than others.</p>

                                    <p class="abstract">Certain places generate inordinate amounts of crime and disorder. We examine how places differ in their nature of crime and disorder, 
                                        with three objectives: (1) identifying a typology of profiles of crime and disorder; (2) assessing whether different forms of crime and disorder 
                                        co-locate at parcels; and (3) determining whether problematic parcels explain crime and disorder across neighborhoods. The study uses 911 and 311 
                                        records to quantify physical and social disorder and violent crime at residential parcels in Boston, MA (n = 81,673). K-means cluster analyses 
                                        identified the typology of problematic parcels and how those types were distributed across census block groups. Cluster analysis identified five types 
                                        of problematic parcels, four specializing in one form of crime or disorder and one that combined all issues. The second cluster analysis found that the 
                                        distribution of problematic parcels described the spectrum from low- to high-crime neighborhoods, plus commercial districts with many parcels with 
                                        public physical disorder. Problematic parcels modestly explained levels of crime across neighborhoods. The results suggest a need for diverse 
                                        intervention strategies to support different types of problematic parcels; and that neighborhood dynamics pertaining to crime are greater than 
                                        problematic properties alone.</p>

                                    <p>Objectives: Scholars and practitioners have paid increasing attention to problematic properties, but little is known about how they emerge and evolve. We
                                        examine four phenomena suggested by life-course theory that reflect stability and change in crime and disorder at properties: onset of issues; 
                                        persistence of issues; aggravation to more serious types of issues; and desistance of issues. We sought to identify the frequency and dynamics of each.</p>
                                    <p>Methods: We analyze how residential parcels (similar to properties) in Boston, MA shifted between profiles of crime and disorder from 2011 to 2018. 
                                        911 dispatches and 311 requests provided six measures of physical disorder, social disorder, and violence for all parcels. K-means clustering placed 
                                        each parcel into one of six profiles of crime and disorder for each year. Markov chains quantified how properties moved between profiles year-to-year.</p>
                                   <p>Results: Onset was relatively infrequent and more often manifested as disorder than violence. Pathways of aggravation led from less serious profiles 
                                       to a mixture of violence and disorder. Desistance was more likely to occur as de-escalations along these pathways then complete cessation of issues. In 
                                       neighborhoods with above-average crime, persistence was more prevalent whereas desistance less often culminated in cessation, even relative to local

                                    <p>Objectives: Test the reliability of geotagged Twitter data for estimating block-level population metrics across place types. Evaluate whether the proportion of 
                                        Twitter users on a block at a given time who are local residents, inter-metro commuters, or tourists is correlated with incidences of public violence and
                                        private conflict for four different time periods: weekday days, weekday nights, weekend days, and weekend nights. </p>
                                    <p>Methods: DBSCAN* machine learning technique is used to estimate the home clusters of 54,249 Twitter users who sent at least one geotagged tweet in Boston. 
                                        Public violence and private conflict are measured using geocoded 911 dispatches. ANOVA models are used to evaluate how the presence of our three groups 
                                        of interests varies across three types of block-level land usage. Hierarchical linear regression models are used to evaluate whether the proportion of 
                                        commuters and tourists at census tract- and block-levels are predictive of crime events across the four time periods of interest.</p>
                                    <p>Results: We find evidence that Twitter data has limited reliability across residential blocks due to data sparseness. For non-residential blocks, we find that commuter and 
                                        tourist presence at the block-level are positively associated with both public violence and private conflict, but that these effects are not stable across time periods. 
                                        Commuters and tourists only effect violence during weekday days, and the effects of commuters and tourists on private conflict are only statistically significant during 
                                        weekday days and weekend days.</p>
                                    <p>Conclusions: Consistent with routine activities and crime pattern theories, the influx of outsiders in a given location impacts the likelihood of crime 
                                        occurring there. While we find that data from Twitter users can be valuable for measuring block-level ambient populations, it appears this is not true 
                                        for residential blocks. Future research may further consider how the characteristics of Twitter users may inform spatial patterns in crime.</p>

                                    <p>Purpose: Despite the rich history of empirical research on neighborhood collective efficacy, studies considering the factors that contribute to 
                                        collective efficacy formation at the individual level have yet to account for family members’ perceptions of collective efficacy. This study examines 
                                        whether individuals form perceptions of neighborhood collective efficacy through knowledge of their geographic locales or via the intra-familial 
                                        transmission of perceptions of collective efficacy.</p>
                                    <p>Methods: This study appends information from the following three distinct samples of adults in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods 
                                        (PHDCN): 349 young adult respondents, their primary caregivers (n = 349), and an independent sample of over 8000 adults distributed across 146 
                                        neighborhoods. Interviews with respondents (average age 20 years; 53.87% female) and their primary caregivers were conducted from 2000 to 2002. 
                                        Regression analysis adjusting for clustering and mediation macros was utilized to examine the research questions.</p>
                                    <p>Results: At baseline, neighborhood collective efficacy was associated with respondents’ perceptions of collective efficacy. The impact of neighborhood 
                                        collective efficacy, however, was mediated completely by parents’ perceptions of collective efficacy. Parents’ perceptions of collective efficacy, 
                                        family support, and concentrated disadvantage were the strongest predictors of respondents’ perceptions of collective efficacy.</p>
                                    <p>Conclusion: Findings suggest that neighborhood collective efficacy can be altered through family processes as well as by changing the structural 
                                        characteristics of broader social settings. Increasing collective efficacy—and social capital more generally—may be best facilitated intergenerationally 
                                        from parents to their children.</p>

                                    <p>Objectives: To examine the extent to which adults’ and youths’ perceptions of collective efficacy align, the shared and unique correlates of adults’ 
                                        and youths’ perceptions, and the effects of adults’ and youths’ perceptions on youths’ violence.</p>
                                    <p>Method: Descriptive analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, and spatial analysis analyze 1,636 youths from the 2008 Boston Youth Survey and 1,677 adults
                                        distributed across 85 neighborhoods from the 2008 Boston Neighborhood Study.</p>
                                    <p>Results: Descriptive analysis indicates that Boston adults’ and youths’ perceptions are largely divergent. Spatial analysis indicates that there is not 
                                        clustering of either adults’ or youths’ perceptions across Boston neighborhoods. Multilevel models indicate that adults’ and youths’ perceptions exhibit
                                        divergent etiology: Adults’ perceptions align closely with neighborhood collective efficacy and with their own neighborhood perceptions, while youths’
                                        perceptions are largely a function of individual differences (race and age) and sociobehavioral factors (social support and educational expectations).
                                        Youths’ perceptions of collective efficacy, rather than aggregated adults’ perceptions of collective efficacy, are inversely associated with youths’ 
                                        violence.</p>
                                    <p>Conclusions: Adults’ and youths’ perceptions of collective efficacy represent distinct constructs. Research should focus on the divergent processes 
                                        through which adults’ and youths’ perceptions are generated and the differential effects of adults’ and youths’ perceptions on youths’ behaviors.</p>
