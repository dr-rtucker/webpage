                                    <p><a href="#" class="abstract-toggle">Abstract</a></p>

                                    <p>Objectives: Some criminologists of place have argued that property owners and place managers
                                        are the key actors exerting guardianship over crime and driving differences in crime across
                                        places, giving rise to the “Neighborhoods Out of Places Explanation” (NOPE) theory of crime.
                                        However, research to date has yet to fully evaluate if crime statistically varies across properties,
                                        their owners, or surrounding geographies.</p>
                                    <p>Methods: Data scraped from Yelp.com is used to identify 1,071 land parcels that had at least one
                                        business receiving reviews from 2014-2020. 911 dispatches for disturbances are linked to parcels
                                        and measured as the rate of events per Yelp reviewer in the average year. Hierarchical linear
                                        modeling-based variance decomposition techniques are used to evaluate how variation in
                                        disturbance rates is distributed across parcels, owners, census blocks, and census tracts. Negative
                                        binomial hierarchical linear models are used to assess the correlates of disturbance rates.
                                        Sensitivity analyses assess the correlates of disturbance rates using a single-level negative
                                        binomial model with bootstrapped standard errors.</p>
                                    <p>Results: Commercial disturbance rates vary across parcels, parcel owners, and blocks. At the
                                        parcel-level, higher Yelp ratings are associated with lower disturbance rates while parcel square
                                        footage is associated with increased disturbance rates. Additionally, parcel-level crime
                                        disturbance rates are explained by block features such as poverty and violent crime</p>
                                    <p>Conclusions: Parcel, owner, and block features can all help explain why some restaurants have
                                        more crime than others. Future research should build on the place management perspective by
                                        investigating the wider breadth of potential actors who may exert guardianship over properties
                                        while acknowledging that offenders and targets systematically vary across geographies, making
                                        effective guardianship more difficult for some guardians than others.</p>

                                    <p class="abstract">Certain places generate inordinate amounts of crime and disorder. We examine how places differ in their nature of crime and disorder, 
                                        with three objectives: (1) identifying a typology of profiles of crime and disorder; (2) assessing whether different forms of crime and disorder 
                                        co-locate at parcels; and (3) determining whether problematic parcels explain crime and disorder across neighborhoods. The study uses 911 and 311 
                                        records to quantify physical and social disorder and violent crime at residential parcels in Boston, MA (n = 81,673). K-means cluster analyses 
                                        identified the typology of problematic parcels and how those types were distributed across census block groups. Cluster analysis identified five types 
                                        of problematic parcels, four specializing in one form of crime or disorder and one that combined all issues. The second cluster analysis found that the 
                                        distribution of problematic parcels described the spectrum from low- to high-crime neighborhoods, plus commercial districts with many parcels with 
                                        public physical disorder. Problematic parcels modestly explained levels of crime across neighborhoods. The results suggest a need for diverse 
                                        intervention strategies to support different types of problematic parcels; and that neighborhood dynamics pertaining to crime are greater than 
                                        problematic properties alone.</p>

                                        we incorporate a novel incident-level variable: distance from incident to trauma hospitals. Results from hierarchical linear models suggest that the

                                        the dynamics of a single metropolitan area and the communities therein, we developed and made publicly available a “data-support system” for the city

                                        Craigslist), capturing aspects of housing and land use, crime and disorder, and commercial activity and institutions. All the data were linked spatially

                                    <p>Objectives: Scholars and practitioners have paid increasing attention to problematic properties, but little is known about how they emerge and evolve. We
                                        examine four phenomena suggested by life-course theory that reflect stability and change in crime and disorder at properties: onset of issues; 
                                        persistence of issues; aggravation to more serious types of issues; and desistance of issues. We sought to identify the frequency and dynamics of each.</p>
                                    <p>Methods: We analyze how residential parcels (similar to properties) in Boston, MA shifted between profiles of crime and disorder from 2011 to 2018. 
                                        911 dispatches and 311 requests provided six measures of physical disorder, social disorder, and violence for all parcels. K-means clustering placed 
                                        each parcel into one of six profiles of crime and disorder for each year. Markov chains quantified how properties moved between profiles year-to-year.</p>
                                   <p>Results: Onset was relatively infrequent and more often manifested as disorder than violence. Pathways of aggravation led from less serious profiles 
                                       to a mixture of violence and disorder. Desistance was more likely to occur as de-escalations along these pathways then complete cessation of issues. In 
                                       neighborhoods with above-average crime, persistence was more prevalent whereas desistance less often culminated in cessation, even relative to local
